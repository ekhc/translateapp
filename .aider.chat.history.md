To fix the `GoogleTranslateServiceImpl` in the `TranslationService.kt` file, I would need to know what specific issues you are encountering or what improvements you would like to make. However, I can provide a general example of how to handle nullability and exceptions in a Kotlin service implementation that interacts with an API.

Here's a diff that shows how you might update a method to handle the possibility of null results and exceptions:

```diff
--- services/TranslationService.kt
+++ services/TranslationService.kt
@@ ... @@
 class GoogleTranslateServiceImpl : TranslationService {
 
-    override fun translateText(text: String, targetLanguage: String): String {
+    override fun translateText(text: String, targetLanguage: String): String? {
         // Assuming translate is an instance of a Google Translate API client
-        val translationResult = translate.translate(text, targetLanguage)
-        return translationResult.translatedText
+        return try {
+            val translationResult = translate.translate(text, targetLanguage)
+            translationResult.translatedText
+        } catch (e: Exception) {
+            // Log the exception, return null, or handle
